# mzEasy 

mzEasy was created with the intention of making the process of converting raw LC-MS/MS data for GNPS a little easier. It also creates QC plots for mzXML LC-MS/MS files with the option of downloading the plots as a pre-assembled image for presentation or publication (multiple image types supported).

While [MSConvert](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.2377) powers the conversions, mzEasy removes the need for choosing settings and allows quick evaluation of LC-MS/MS data quality, both of which are barriers of entry for using more advanced tools such as GNPS.

mzEasy uses the default vendor/MSConvert peak-picking settings as suggested in GNPS documentation. For more control consider using more advanced peak-picking procedures such as found at http://mzmine.github.io (e.g. https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.7b01563). mzXML files generated by other means such as MZmine can still be evaulated in mzEASY. Using the button "Click to select where mzXML files should be created", select any folder containing mzXML files to automatically generate summary plots.

## Setup:
The setup below should be fairly painless even though it looks long. The length is my trying to be more thorough in instruction and include details for those that might have less experience working with Windows.

## Installing Proteowizard
#### If you want to use mzEasy to convert files, you will need to install ProteoWizard.

If you have already installed ProteoWizard, mzEasy will try to find it for you and you likely won't have to do anything else. If mzEasy is unable to find it, try adding its location to "~mzEasy/Specify_ProteoWizard_Location.txt", as shown later in the this document.


- You can download the ProteoWizard Installer from here:  [http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/download.html](http://proteowizard.sourceforge.net/download.html)


- Note: If you experience that mzEasy/MSConvert can't convert files, you may need to install: [Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=17851)

| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Double-click the downloaded ".msi" file to begin installion. (Or right-click, then left-click "Install") |  <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/0.PNG"  width=500 /> |
| Click "Run"                  | <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/1.PNG"  width=500 /> |
| Click "Next" | <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/2.PNG"  width=500 /> |
| You will then be shown this screen: | <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/5.PNG"  width=500 /> |

<br> <br>
Copy the installation location and paste it somewhere in case mzEasy cannot find ProteoWizard the first time it's run.

#### If mzEasy can't find MSConvert:

|                              |                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Go to the mzEasy folder and inside you will see a file "Specify_ProteoWizard_Location.txt".  | <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/10.PNG"  width=500 /> |
| Open the file   | <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/4.PNG"  width=500 /> |
| Copy the location ProteWizard was installed to (left side of image). Paste this into "Specify_ProteoWizard_Location.txt" document (right side of image). Save "Specify_ProteoWizard_Location.txt" and close it.| <img src= "www/tutorial/pwiz/12.png"  width=500 /> |
